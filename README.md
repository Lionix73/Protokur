# Protokur

**Protokur** is a solo-developed prototype inspired by the fast-paced movement mechanics found in games like *Mirror’s Edge* and *Titanfall*. This project began as a personal learning experience, aiming to push the boundaries of my development skills and explore how far I can go as an indie dev. My goal is to build a minimum viable product that feels fluid, responsive, and engaging while focusing on parkour mechanics.

## Features

- **Dynamic Movement**: 
  - Wallrunning, vaulting, sliding, crouching, and jumping mechanics inspired by first-person parkour games.
  - Grappling gun for enhanced mobility and interaction with the environment.
  - Feedback effects while running for an immersive experience.

- **Level Design**:
  - A testing gym environment for experimenting with movement and greyboxed levels with fine-tuned metrics for fluid gameplay.

- **Prototyping**:
  - Early-stage physics-based interactions with platforms, traps, and breakable objects.
  - Various visual effects and post-processing techniques to enhance the atmosphere and player feedback.

## Development Goals

The focus of *Protokur* is to continuously refine the mechanics and world-building, implementing features such as:
- Enemies and combat mechanics.
- Breakable doors and windows.
- Advanced platforming challenges and traps.
- Sound design and atmospheric effects.
  
I work on *Protokur* periodically in my free time as a way to learn new techniques and experiment with game development. As the project progresses, I plan to add more layers of complexity, polish the mechanics, and ensure a smooth and fun gameplay experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Engine**: Unity 3D
- **Programming Language**: C#
- **Assets**: Custom scripts for movement and interaction
- **Tools**: Unity Particle Systems, ShaderGraphs, Post-processing Stack, Photoshop.
